              This portfolio shows some of the productions I have been involved
              with over the years as sole or lead developer or with significant
              hands-on input as a senior team member.

              This site was written in React and Redux (hooks) as a single page
              application using Create-React-App for a webpack setup and
              Material-UI components for a quick start, in my commercial work
              everything is typically created bespoke from scratch. <br />
